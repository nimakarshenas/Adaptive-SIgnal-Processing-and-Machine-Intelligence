Otherwise, your progress might be **completely lost without any chance of restroing it**. \n\n<img src=\"./imgs/notebook_download.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\" id=\"notebook_download\"/>\n\n- Do not panic if you have accidentely closed this tab. There is certain time period before binder server completely shuts down. Respectively, you should not be inactive for a long period of time without downloading the latest progress as well. You can reopen this tab either by pressing `Ctrl-Shift-T` (use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl` for Mac) or by  clicking on the `binder` badge on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IlyaKisil/dpm-coursework).\n\n- If you decided to complete assignments on `binder`, you can do so within multiple binder session (different days). When you connect to binder for the second (or any consequent) time, you will need to upload you notebook which you had previously downloaded (see Step 1). In order to do that, just drag and drop you notebook, into the file browser, as shown in the image below.\n\n<img src=\"./imgs/notebook_upload.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n\n> **NOTE:** This will replace exsiting file with the same name. If you want to keep original version of a notebook, make sure that you had duplicated it before  you uploaded your file.\n\n---------------","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n\n* [Prerequisites and materials](#Prerequisites-and-materials)\n* [Assignments](#Assignments)\n* [After completing assignments](#After-completing-assignments)\n* [Submiting results](#Submiting-results)\n* [Reporting problems and issues](#Reporting-problems-and-issues)","metadata":{"toc-hr-collapsed":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Prerequisites and materials\n\nThrough out this assignment you will become familiar with several Python libraries:\n\n1. [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.1/user/index.html) - the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python,\n2. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - 2D plotting library in Python which provides interface similar to MATLAB,\n3. [HOTTBOX](https://hottbox.github.io/stable/index.html) - our own toolbox for multilinear analysis and tensor decompositions, which is built on top of NumPy.\n\nMost of the tasks will come with relevant code snippets, templates and examples, and you are also encouraged to become familiar with these libraries for your own curiousity.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Assignments\n\n### [Module 1: Tensors and basic operations](./1_Tensors_and_basic_operations.ipynb)\n\n### [Module 2: Efficient representation of multidimensional arrays](./2_Efficient_representation_of_multidimensional_arrays.ipynb)\n\n### [Module 3: Tucker decomposition and applications](./3_Tucker_decomposition_and_applications.ipynb)\n","metadata":{"toc-hr-collapsed":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# After completing assignments\n\n1. Upon completing a Jupyter notebook with assignments, make sure that all cells have been sequentially executed from the very first one.

If you opted for completing assignments on you own PC, then no download is required since this file is already on your computer.\n\n1.

For example, if your Imperial ID is `abc123` and you want to complete assignments specified in `File_1.ipynb`, then the new filename should be `abc123_File_1.ipynb`.
